a.
Schema: R(A, B, C, D, E)
Functional dependencies: D->B, CE->A

Iter. 1
For set {C, E}
{C, E}+ = {C, E, A}
{C, E}+ does not equal {C, E} and {C, E}+ does not equal {A, B, C, D, E}
R(A, B, C, D, E) decomposes to R1(C, E, A) and R2(C, E, B, D)


Iter. 2
For set {D} in R2(C, E, B, D)
{D}+ = {D, B}
{D}+ does not equal {D} and {D}+ does not equal {C, E, B, D}
So R2(C, E, B, D) decomposes into R21(D, B) and R2(D, C, E)


Iter. 3
R(A, B, C, D, E) decomposes to R1(C, E, A), R2(C, E, B, D), R21(D, B)
No X such that X does not equal X+ and X does not equal all attributes. This is BCNF


b.
Schema: S(A, B, C, D, E)
Functional dependencies: A->E, BC->A, DE->B

Iter. 1
Set {B, C}
{B, C}+ = {B, C, A, E}
{B, C}+ does not equal {B, C} and {B, C}+ does not equal to {A, B, C, D, E}
S(A, B, C, D, E) decomposes to S1(B, C, A, E) and S2(B, C, D)

Iter. 2
Set {A} in S1(B, C, A, E).
{A}+ = {A, E}
{A}+ does not equal {A} and {A}+ != {B, C, A, E}
S1(B, C, A, E) decomposes into S11(A, E) and S12(A, B, C)

Iter. 3
S(A, B, C, D, E) decomposes into S11(A, E), S12(A, B, C) and S2(B, C, D)
No X such that X does not equal X+ and X does not equal all attributes. This is BCNF



c. All subsets are closed

Lets assume there is a functional dependency A->B. If it exists, {A}+ = {A, B} != {A}.
The presence of any functional dependency that Functional dependancy on the left hand side will not be closed.
To have all sets of attr. be closed, must be zero functional dependencies

d. Assume these functional dependencies
A->B
B->C
C->D
D->A

If one of the attributes is on the left hand side of the functional dependancy, then all attributes
will be on the right in X+. So for this, the only closed attributes will be {} and {A, B, C, D}. Required
functional dependencies for this case:
A->B
B->C
C->D
D->A

e.
{B}+ is not {B}, and since {B, C}+ = {B, C}, B->C is a functional dependancy. With a similar argument, we have
that B -> C is also a functional dependancy.  
possible answer: {A -> BCD, D -> ABC, B->C, C->B}
