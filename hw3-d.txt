Personally, I would recommend to a fellow student to use DBMS for tinkering/experimenation. I feel that 
learning cloud-hosted database management was pretty useful, however it did have some flaws regarding performance and speed that left some to be desired.
For example, running the queries took especially long and even being slown down by errors that you do not expect was frustrating.
I would also recommend it to a future co-worker for a project so that it is easier to manage the data remotely by simply logging into
the cloud service, as well as giving others access that you would be unable to give on your local machine.
